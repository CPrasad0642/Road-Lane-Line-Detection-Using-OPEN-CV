# Road Lane Line detection using OPEN CV
Lane line detection is a critical component for self-driving cars because detection of lanes in a road is an important factor for automatic cars to move the car in their respective lanes to avoid accidents.

:pushpin:**Existing System :**

Some existing technologies utilize some kind of sensor such asÂ Lidar, Radar, and vision sensors. In which, Lidar and radar are only used for obstacle detection, unique vision sensors are used for lane detection and vehicle detection.

:pushpin:**Disadvantages of Existing System :**
* There is an increase in autonomous vehicles and these vehicles do not have proper guidance leading to accidents. 
* Most existing lane line detection algorithms are mainly designed for structured roads, due to the influence of the surrounding environment of the road, such as the influence of shadows of surrounding trees or buildings and the pair of vehicles ahead of the road. 

:pushpin:**Proposed System :**
* The proposed system utilizes road lane detection algorithm for road lane identification. This is to helps the autonomous vehicles to identify the road lanes.
* The techniques used to detect mathematical shapes like this is called Hough Transform Hough Transform can detect shapes like circles, rectangles, triangles and lines.
